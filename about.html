            <p class="body-text-about">
                I'm Vinay Kumar, an enthusiastic Interaction Design student at the Industrial Design Center, Indian
                Institute of Technology, Bombay.
                My journey in the design world has kindled a deep passion for humanizing technology through design. I'm
                committed to crafting user-centered experiences that deeply resonate with people. My design philosophy
                is
                rooted in the constructivist ideology, where I strongly believe in design's transformative power. It has
                the
                ability to shape and enhance our interactions with the world. I approach my work with a social
                perspective,
                understanding the profound impact design can have on society and addressing real-life challenges with
                innovative solutions.
